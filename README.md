# NixOS Configuration Repository

This repository contains all configuration files for my NixOS system. It utilizes the Nix Flakes system to manage and reproduce the configurations across different hosts.

The system is set up with x11, i3, qutebrowser, helix, fish amongst other applications. Secrets and passwords are managed by 1password and the cli integration. It is mostly themed to dracula theme.
